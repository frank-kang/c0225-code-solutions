## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the `&&` (logical AND) and `||` (logical OR) operators and how can they be used outside of `if` statements?
  to set values depending on truthy of falseness of the first expression.
- What is "short-circuit evaluation" and how does it apply to `&&` and `||`?
  skips evaluating the second part of a boolean expression if the first part is enough to determine the outcome.
- What is the `??` (nullish coalescing) operator and how does it differ from `||`?
  handles cases where variables might be null or undefined.
- What is the `?:` (ternary) operator? How does it differ from `if/else`?
  it's a shorthand for if/else.
- What is the `?.` (optional chaining) operator? When would you use it?
  to attempt to access properties that might not exist.
- What is `...` (spread) syntax? How do you use it with arrays and objects?
  clones or merges objects and arrays.
- What data types can be spread into an array? Into an object?
  Number and strings or other arrays for arrays and property values pairs or other objects for objects.
- How does spread syntax differ from rest syntax?
  Spread syntax "expands" an array or object into its individual elements, while rest syntax "collects" multiple elements or properties into a single array. They are performing opposite actions.
